# Senior Project

This is my high school senior project. It is a small level of a game made with Unity and Blender. 

Doing this project I learned about many things:
 - Game Engines
 - C# and APIs
 - Version Control
 - Software Planning
 - 3D modeling
 - Texturing and materials
 - Basics of 3D graphics.
 
 
 Within this repository you can find all of my models, levels, and C# scripts.
 
 This project got a 95%.
